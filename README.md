> "An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple, for an idiot anything the more complicated it is the more he will admire it, if you make something so clusterf*cked he can't understand it he's gonna think you're a god cause you made it so complicated nobody can understand it." - Terry A. Davis
